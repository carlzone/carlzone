- 👋 Hi, I’m @carlzone
- 👀 I’m interested in building websites from ground up or just parts a page of it. Also I'm into compiling animations using css for more visual attraction on website.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning reactjs and nodejs as I'm originally a PHP web dev that uses a PHP framework CodeIgniter 3. I'm also trying absorb all the things I have lern on
WebRTC for real-time communication since I'm trying to figure out why some device wont display the camera. But well that's what makes programming fun.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating PHP x NodeJS since PHP is not a good tool for creating a video chat but got foundation in data management keeping.
- 📫 How to reach me is via gmail account ckevin.enoz@gmail.com.
